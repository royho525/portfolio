            Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the free human mind. Because <br>   
            it tranforms who are, how we live, and it gives us an understanding of our place in the universe.

        <p>
            The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for life as we know it are everywhere, so there's <br>
            no reason to think that Earth would be unique in that regard. Whether of not the life became <br>
            intelligent is a differnent question, and we'll see if we find that.

            our system to disrupt transportation, communication, the food chains, and that can be a really bad <br>
